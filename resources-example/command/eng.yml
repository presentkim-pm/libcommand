# Some of these settings are safe, others can break your server if modified incorrectly
# New settings/defaults won't appear automatically on this file when upgrading

  #Name of main command
  #You can change this to be what you want
  name: "example"

  #Permission of main command
  #You can change this to be what you want
  permission: "op"

  #Aliases of main command
  #You can add, replace, or remove them as you like
  aliases: ["examplecommand", "예제"]

    #Setting of subcommands
    #Same as main command setting
